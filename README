Instructions:

Note that in the following instructions, 'files/', 'css/', and so on refer to the default paths for their respective types of content, as set in /config.inc.

To modify content, modify HTML files in 'files/'. Keep in mind that they get parsed as PHP, with config.php automatically included, in order to allow for dynamic content and access to the $PATH variable.

To modify CSS, modify files in 'css/'. CSS files are present for: default, IE, IE7-, IE6-.

To modify page titles, modify the second line of files.csv.

To add a page, add relevant entries in files.csv, create a new file in 'files/', create a new directory named after the file, and place the same index.php and blank.html in this directory as in other content files' directories (i.e. 'about/').

To add content in between the <head> tags, place it in 'files/header.html'.

A 'images/' directory exists for images, but it has no particular hard-coded significance, and its usage is not a requirement.

To clear the cache for a specific file, remove it from the 'cache/' directory. If you remove the entire directory, you will have to create a new, chmodded one. Failure to do so will result in undefined behavior.

To add an embedded (data: URL) image, you must use the addEmbeddedImageToCSS(id, file); function. It returns part of the div (the <div id="$id"), assumes that file is in 'images/', and adds the image to a database, to be added to the CSS, and possibly MHTML (for IE.) Keep in mind that you cannot use an id that begins with an underscore. Due to IE8, data: URLs cannot be more than 32 KB in length.

Apache Configuration:

Disable ETags if Last-Modified is supported.

Another recommended change is to hide the Server information in the HTTP header with ServerTokens.

	Example Config:
FileETag none
ServerSignature Off
ServerTokens Prod
